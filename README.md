This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `git clone {repository url}`
### `yarn add`
### `yarn start`

## I put my API key into a dotenv file, which someone would not be able to access if they were to clone my repo. You would need your own unique API key.
## The user must hover over or click on an image in order to see the caption, which is unique to each photo, it's just that there is the same caption for each photo. 
### The user can like and unlike photos
